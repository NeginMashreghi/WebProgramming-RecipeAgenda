# RecipeAgenda

### Description of activities that will be performed as part of the project.

The idea of our application is that a user can create their own account, add recipes to it and share them with others. There are 2 main purposes for this application: one purpose is for people who one want to have their recipes organized online. And the second purpose for this application is to encourage people that don’t know how to cook or don’t want to spend money outside to try other users’ recipes that they would find through our application.

### Expected results

Now the question is what the user can do with this app

- Register and create account
- Share/add/delete recipes
- Follow other people’s pages
    - see their recipes
    - add the recipes that they like to their account
    - comment on recipes
- Log out and log in
- Edit their profile
